# HKUST Robotics Team STM32F103 SPL Library

Seriously don't use this library, go use libOpenCM3 or HAL unless you're desperate, BUT I guarantee it's much better 
than the spaghetti code than what the internal people use. Bonus points for being open source.

Ironic huh? We're part of HKUST but using the MIT License :thinking:

```kotlin
class HKUSTLicense(): MITLicense() {
    init {
        println("This is obviously an HKUST License")
    }
}
```
