# HKUST Robotics Team STM32F103 SPL Library (Deprecated)

**Note: Deprecated. All efforts are migrated to [RTLib](https://www.github.com/Derppening/RTLib).**

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Derppening/stm32f103.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Derppening/stm32f103)

Seriously don't use this library, go use libOpenCM3 or HAL unless you're desperate, BUT I guarantee it's much better 
than the spaghetti code than what the internal people use. Bonus points for being open source.

# Documentation

[Blah don't use the wiki, doxygen docs FTW!](https://Derppening.github.io/stm32f103/)

# License

Ironic huh? We're part of HKUST but using the MIT License :thinking:

```cpp
class HKUSTLicense : public MITLicense {
  public:
    HKUSTLicense() {
        std::cout << "This is definitely an HKUST License. *Believe me*." << std::endl;
    }
}
```
